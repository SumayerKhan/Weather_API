"""
Weather Data API with Flask
---------------------------
This application serves a small web UI and several JSON API endpoints to access
historical weather station data (daily mean temperatures). Data files come from
an external source and include multi-line headers plus some quirks such as:

- Column names with leading spaces (e.g., "    DATE", "   TG", " Q_TG", " SOUID").
- Missing temperature values encoded as the sentinel -9999 (must be filtered out).
- Station files named as TG_STAIDXXXXXX.txt where XXXXXX is a 6-digit STAID.

Key Endpoints
-------------
- GET /                      : Simple homepage showing the list of stations.
- GET /api/v1/<station>/<date>
                             : Temperature (째C) for one station on one date.
- GET /api/v1/<station>      : All cleaned rows for one station (JSON array).
- GET /api/v1/annual/<station>/<year>
                             : All rows for a given year (string match on DATE).

Notes
-----
- When we need date equality comparisons, we parse dates to datetime at read time.
- When we need "starts with year" filtering, we coerce DATE to string then use
  vectorized string operations (Series.str.*).
